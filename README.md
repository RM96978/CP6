Thymeleaf Spring-MVC Maven Archetype
====================================

This project is a maven archetype for creating a web application with Thymeleaf and Spring.

Thymeleaf
---------

The main goal of Thymeleaf is to provide an elegant and well-formed way of creating HTML 5 templates. Its Standard and SpringStandard dialects allow you to create powerful natural templates, that can be correctly displayed by browsers and therefore work also as static prototypes.

Application

This web application is composed by two html templates `WEB-INF/views` one for showing a form using HTML5 and CSS3 and another one for listing inserted data.
